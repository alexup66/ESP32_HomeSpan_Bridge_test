# ESP32_HomeSpan_Bridge_test
I'm a student and just started "play" with homekit smart devices.

Used ESP32 wroom dev.kit v.1 board.

Used HomeSpan project examples.

In this example implemented 2 switches controlled by 2 SpanButtons, 1 dimmable led controlled by SpanButton, 
and fading led controlled by SpanButton.

Added setStatusPin and setControlPin.

Special thanks to Gregg E. Berman for this amazing project!
